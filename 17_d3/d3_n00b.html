<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

  .chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;
  margin: 1px;

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...
    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");
    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");
    (this defines selection to which you will join data)
    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);
    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");
    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });
    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });

  <!-- Our observations:
  * You can enter a function directly into the parameter of a function (for example to text())
  * You can add elements repeatedly using append(). The element doesn't already have to exist in the HTML and you don't have to clone it.
  * It is somewhat object-oriented (?) because bar can call the functions onto itself.
  * You can concatenate strings (which is something you couldn't do in Java)
  Questions: -stuff we were originally wondering
  * What is the point of doing enter() before append()?
  * What can you join to an HTML element? Does it have to be an array?
  * How could you create more than one div for each element in the array?
  * What is the parameter d passed into the function for style() and text()? Is it each element of the array?  -->
