Version 1:
  Prediction:
    - an alert should be displayed that prints the word that was clicked
  Observations:
    - it did what we predicted

Version 2:
  Prediction:
    - the table will print, but the alerts might not work / be overriden
  Observations:
    - printed three alerts
    - first was the tds, then the trs, then the entire table
  Questions:
    - why would you want multiple alerts in a row instead of one large alert?
    - why that order?

Version 3:
  Prediction:
    - it looks similar to the last one, so maybe it will print the same but different order
    - the commented line might stop the alerts
  Observations:
    - it acted the same as #2, but in a different order
    - the commented section made only the whole table print
  Question:
    - What does stopPropagation target?

Version 4:
  Prediction:
    - the order of the alerts will change again
  Observation:
    - Our prediction was correct and it looks like it prints the whole table first then down to the smallest.
